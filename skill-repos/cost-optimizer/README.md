## 📦 What's Included

A comprehensive guide that teaches you to:

- **Route intelligently** — match model capability to task complexity instead of sending everything to Opus
- **Cache aggressively** — stop paying full price for static system prompts on every API call
- **Optimize cron jobs & heartbeats** — the #1 source of wasted spend
- **Evaluate local models** — zero marginal cost for routine tasks
- **Use routing tools** — ClawRouter, OpenRouter, or build your own
