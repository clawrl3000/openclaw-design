## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Cold Outreach

**You ask**: "Write a cold email to a potential client for my web design services"

**Your agent**: *Creates a personalized, compelling cold email using proven frameworks like AIDA or PAS. Includes specific value propositions, social proof, and a clear call-to-action. Avoids spam triggers while maintaining authenticity and building genuine connection.*

---

### Example 2: Follow-up Sequence

**You ask**: "Create a 3-email follow-up sequence for prospects who didn't reply"

**Your agent**: *Designs a strategic follow-up sequence with varying approaches: 1) Value-add with helpful resource, 2) Different angle/benefit focus, 3) Soft "break-up" email. Each email maintains professionalism while increasing urgency appropriately.*

---

### Example 3: Customer Support Excellence

**You ask**: "Help me respond to this frustrated customer complaint about late delivery"

**Your agent**: *Analyzes the customer's emotional state and specific concerns. Crafts an empathetic response that acknowledges the problem, takes responsibility without over-apologizing, provides concrete solutions, and includes proactive measures to prevent recurrence. Maintains brand voice while rebuilding trust.*

## ⚙️ Configuration

This skill works out of the box with no configuration needed.

**Optional Customization**: Edit the skill file to add:
- Your company's specific voice and tone guidelines
- Industry-specific email templates
- Your most successful email frameworks
- Custom signature templates

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Agent isn't using the skill

1. **Verify file location**: Make sure `SKILL.md` is in your agent's `skills/` folder
2. **Check file format**: The file should be plain text/markdown, not a Word doc
3. **Restart agent**: Some agents need a restart to pick up new skills
4. **Check logs**: Look for any error messages when the agent starts

### Skill triggers at wrong times

The skill activates when you mention: email, cold outreach, follow-up, customer support, sales emails, email templates, email marketing, newsletters, email responses

If it's triggering incorrectly, try being more specific with your requests.

### Emails sound too generic

Try providing more context:
- Who is the recipient? (role, industry, company size)
- What's your relationship? (cold contact, existing customer, etc.)
- What's your goal? (meeting, sale, information, etc.)
- What's your value proposition?

The more context you provide, the more personalized the emails become.
